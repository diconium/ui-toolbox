# Drawer

The Drawer component implements swipeable behavior from `react-swipeable` and can be swiped up (to open)
and swiped down (to close).

To import the `Drawer` component simply include the following at the top of your file:

```
import { Drawer } from '@diconium/ui-toolbox';
```

## Default

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.Default} />

## Open and Close

Clicking on the handle on the top will open and close the drawer content.

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.Opened} />

## Different layouts for the content area

The Drawer components supports two different layouts: `centered`(default) and `full-width` as shown below:

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.DifferentContentLayouts} />
