# Searchbar

To import the `Searchbar` component simply include the following at the top of your file:

```
import { Searchbar } from '@dicoauto/toolbox';
```

## Default

<Canvas of={SearchbarStories.Default} />

## Disabled

<Canvas of={SearchbarStories.Disabled} />

## onSearch action

When the user presses the `enter` on the keyboard, the `onSearch` action is called once.
Use this when you want to trigger a search, only after the user pressed enter.

<Canvas of={SearchbarStories.OnSearchAction} />

## onChange action

When the user enters a new character on the keyboard, the `onChange` action is called.
This can be useful when you want to trigger a search instantly when the input of the search field changes.

<Canvas of={SearchbarStories.OnChangeAction} />
