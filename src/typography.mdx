## Typography

The standard font family for this library is the google font [Montserrat](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap).
We support multiple font weights ranging from `Thin (100)` to `Black (900)`,
with `Regular (400)` and `SemiBold (600)` being commonly used.
When you include this package in your project, the default weight will be applied automatically.
